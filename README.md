Summary
-------

Enables log-based architectures with realtime streaming, unlimited storage, compression and encryption.

| Key facts               |                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technologies            | Golang, Linux, Docker (not required for use), AWS S3.                                    |
| Production ready?       | No, not yet. But not too far away.                                                       |
| Msg delivery semantics  | Exactly once, exact in-order delivery within a stream.                                   |
| Use cases               | High availability software, datacenter failover and microservices.                       |
| Storage capacity        | Practically unlimited. You have to pay your bills though. :)                             |
| Data durability         | All writes transactionally backed by Write-Ahead-Log just like in databases.             |
| High availability       | Planned, going to use Hashicorp's Raft implementation.                                   |
| Data stored at          | AWS S3. Google Storage support planned.                                                  |
| Encryption at transport | TLS (CA & server certs automatically managed)                                            |
| Encryption at rest      | AES-CBC. Encryption keys are not trusted to AWS (=> not using S3 server-side encryption) |

Architecture
------------

Writer manages writes to streams. Streams are divided into ~8 MB chunks which
are stored compressed & encrypted in AWS S3, except the last, "live", chunk that
we're writing into.

![](docs/architecture/diagram.png)

Quick glance:

- Somebody contacts Writer to append a line to the stream
- Writer notifies pub/sub that a stream has new lines
- All interested applications that want to read from any streams have a Pusher,
  which subscribes to pub/sub notifications for those streams.
- Once the Pusher learns of new events, it issues a read to either:
	- a Writer if it's live data OR
	- S3 if it's older data.
- Pusher then pushes this read to your application. Your application transactionally
  verifies that the read offset is at the offset of last stored write in database.
  If not, error is returned along with the correct offset, and Pusher continues
  to read from the correct offset.
